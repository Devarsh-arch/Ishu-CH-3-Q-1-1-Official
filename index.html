<h3>History of chocolates</h3>
<p>The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 450 BC. 
The Mexica believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much 
value that they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter liquid,
 mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to be an aphrodisiac and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks
 are also known as "Chilate" and are made by locals in the south of Mexico and the north triangle of Central America
 (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it 
became popular throughout society, first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th
 century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers during war. The word "chocolate" 
comes from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolātl, of uncertain etymology, and entered the English language from the
 Spanish language.

<h3>How to make chocolate at home</h3>
<p>Grate 1/2 cup of the cocoa butter. It will melt easier when it’s grated. Measure also 1/2 cup of coconut oil.
Place cocoa butter and coconut oil in a water in a small, heat-safe cup or bowl. Then place the cup or bowl in a shallow pan
 containing a small amount of warm (not boiling, but nearly) water. Stir the oil and butter occasionally until it’s smooth.
Measure 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  If you’d like to add any other dry ingredients, measure them out now and stir them 
together with the cocoa powder.  Note: In this recipe, I used 1/4 cup lucuma powder and 1 tbsp. Natural vanilla or 
vanilla extract would work here also.Pour the dry ingredients in the bowl with melted oil and butter. Stir continuously until 
smooth.Have someone check the quality. Meaning… go ahead and check if the chocolate is sweet enough. You can also 
add the rest of the additions at this point – like chili/cayenne, dried fruit, nuts etc.Pour the melted chocolate on a
 pan / plate / ice cube tray. You can also throw some of the additions on top of the chocolate, it looks nice. Place the 
chocolate for 30 minutes in the freezer or 60 minutes in the refrigerator.
